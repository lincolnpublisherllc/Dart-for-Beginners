Dart for Beginners â€” Code Extraction

This archive contains code and command snippets extracted from the uploaded manuscript, organized by chapter.

Structure

One folder per chapter, prefixed with the chapter number.

.dart files are Dart snippets.

.sh files are terminal/command examples (macOS/Linux) as shown in the book.

A README.md file (this one) provides a quick overview of the contents.

Notes

Extraction was done heuristically from a .docx file, so formatting may vary slightly from the book.

Terminal/command examples are included for completeness alongside the Dart code.

If you notice a snippet in the wrong folder or want renaming/merging, adjust by chapter and snippet number.

Tip: Use the chapter folders as a reference when following along with the book, so you can run the examples in your own Dart environment.
